## Multiview and Control GUI of Gopro Hero 4

This is a GUI for Gopro Hero 4. Using multiple network adapters connected with each gopro, this program can take control of multiple gopros and enable live preview and file transfer.

Be sure that every connected gopro has an IP like 10.5.5.* (this could be manually assigned).
